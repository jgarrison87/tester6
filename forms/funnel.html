        Please take a moment to read through and consider before applying:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1)</strong> This is not a "get rich quick" scheme. You will
          not be able to push a button and make money. This is a business.
          However, when the right mentorship meets passion and drive, big things
          can happen financially. I will not build your business for you, but am
          here to help you and support you the best I possibly can!
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>2)</strong> Our team mission is to leave people in a better
          place than where we found them. We strive to positively touch lives
          through, Friendship, Education, Love and Mentorship.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>3)</strong> We're looking for leaders. People that have a
          burning desire to create change in their own lives and the lives of
          others. The Xyngular opportunity unlocked freedom for me and my
          family. If you have a desire to succeed and have a passion for helping
          others - This may be <strong>EXACTLY</strong> what you're looking for!
        </li>
