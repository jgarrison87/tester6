            Whether you have tried other <i>"side gigs"</i> or not.  Trust us when we say <strong>WE ARE DIFFERENT.</strong>  For starters, from corporate leaders down to every single person on our team – <strong>WE CARE.</strong>  We want you to achieve <u>YOUR</u> goals and so much more!  You will not find a more caring and supportive group of people to work and do life with! 
            <br>
            <br>
            Secondly, when our founders created this company, they had <em>50+ years of experience</em> in the network marketing industry so they <strong>KNEW</strong> what worked and what did not work.  They knew exactly how they wanted the <u>compensation</u> plan to work and their main goal was to <u>make it achievable for the average person.</u>  That is why our compensation plan has no hoops or loops to jump through, no crazy requirements that will drive you to burnout.  Just a <strong>simple</strong> way of sharing and getting paid to do so.

          You are probably thinking to yourself, <u>"yea, but HOW?</u>.  Well, we have <em>tools</em> and <em>resources</em> to help and your <strong>team leaders</strong> will be right there with you every step of the way.  Really, we will!  We get more joy out of <strong>helping you crush your goals</strong> than we do crushing our own.  True story.

        <br>
        <p>We already touched on it but it is so <u>important</u>, it deserves to be mentioned again.  Your founders created this compensation plan for you.  So you don’t have any prior network marketing experience, who cares?!  What matters is you found a <strong>product line</strong> that you love and that <strong>WORKS</strong>.  Now you just have to share it with others, connect them to your team leaders and invite them to give it a try. 
          <br>
          <br> Many <em><u>other companies</u></em> have luxury car programs (aka programs requiring you to maintain <strong>certain sales quotas</strong> to continue earning that bonus otherwise you pay for it out of your own pocket) and <strong>complicated bonus pools.</strong>  <strong><u>WE</u></strong> do 2 simple things:  <strong><u>WE</u></strong> pay you in cash, DAILY, and <strong><u>WE</u></strong> pay you in trips.  Oh and <strong><u>WE</u></strong> pay for a loved one to go on these trips with you; yup, <strong>ALL EXPENSE PAID FOR TWO</strong>, including airfare! 
          <br>
          <br>
          Oh and did I mention that <U>ALL levels</U> and ranks earn a <strong>bonus EACH month</strong> from what we call the <u>Profit Sharing Bonus Pool?</u>  Yup, you read that right – <strong>EVERY SINGLE RANK.</strong>  You don’t have to wait till you hit the upper ranks to be earning bonuses, you earn one from the very first rank.  Did we mention that <u>our company built this compensation plan <strong>FOR YOU?</strong></u>  
          <br>
          <br> 
          So if you want to <u>build a stream of income on your OWN TIME,</u> from wherever you want, without any hoops to jump through, sales quotas to hit or inventory to carry – <strong>it's time we talk.  Join us!</strong>
